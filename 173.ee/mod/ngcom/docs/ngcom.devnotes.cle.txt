		CLEditor XHTML Plugin v1.0.0
		changed jquery.cleditor.xhtml.js (uncompressed)
		from
			#193	results += (unary ? "/" : "") + ">";
		to
			#193	results += (unary ? " /" : "") + ">";
			
		reason: unary tags expl. <br> should become <br /> instead <br/>
		
		I have the bug reported to github.
		please only use the (modified) uncompressed xhtml.js

		within the pws fc cle interaction, the form data for
		the editor uses data- attributes that are part of the
		w3c html5 specifications.
		At the moment, xhtml complains about such attributes.
		The data- attributes are used only together with the
		editor, but not together with the content produced by
		cleditor. Thus, designed html should be xhtml conform,
		while the editor self does not. Worth to ignore.

		Observation:
		the xhtml cle if is not "instances" save,
		i.e. if blog is called and the two editors on the page
		(summary and entry) are not changed both, the untouched
		editor textarea will not being xhtml styled.
		Have still to think about what to do.
