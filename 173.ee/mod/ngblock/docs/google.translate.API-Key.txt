google.translate.API-Key

The Google Translate API Key is required when using Google Translation services together
with module ngBlock only to perform the translate functions. Neither the whole workflow
nor the site's gettext translations need that api key.

A single API key will be valid for a single "directory" or domain.
You have to have a Google Account to get such an API key, and your API key
will be connected to your Google Account.

see: http://code.google.com/apis/language/translate/v2/getting_started.html

If you don't have such key, you will get a google.translate.API-Key from
	https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount
Never use strange keys, because they will not work with invalid domain assignments.

Important note:
Google changed the Terms of Services in 2012 and the google translate API is no
longer free of charge. For this reason, the integration of google translate within
ngBlock is kept as is in the module, but WILL NOT BE MAINTENED FURTHERMORE.
